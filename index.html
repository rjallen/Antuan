<p>The Super Bowl is the annual championship game of the National Football League (NFL), the highest level of professional American football in the United States, culminating a season that begins in the late summer of the previous calendar year. The Super Bowl uses Roman numerals to identify each game, rather than the year in which it is held

The Seahawks won their first Super Bowl crown in overpowering fashion, punishing Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos, 43-8. That masterful defense, the NFL's stingiest, never let the five-time Most Valuable Player get going, disarming the highest-scoring offense in league history. </p>
